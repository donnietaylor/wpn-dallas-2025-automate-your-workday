# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AI automation in 15 minutes! This guide will help you set up a basic AI automation workflow.

## 🚀 15-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Choose Your Language (2 minutes)

**Python** (Recommended for beginners)
```bash
python --version  # Should be 3.8+
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

**JavaScript/Node.js** (Great for web integration)
```bash
node --version    # Should be 16+
npm install openai dotenv
```

### Step 2: Get API Access (3 minutes)

1. **OpenAI Account**: Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. **Create API Key**: Navigate to API Keys section
3. **Copy Key**: Save it securely (you'll need it in the next step)

### Step 3: Set Up Environment (2 minutes)

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Never commit this file to version control!

### Step 4: Run Your First Automation (5 minutes)

#### Python Example
```python
# quick_start.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import openai

load_dotenv()
client = openai.OpenAI()

def automate_email_response(email_content):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that drafts professional email responses."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Draft a response to this email: {email_content}"}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Test it out
email = "Hi, I need help with setting up the new software. When can we schedule a call?"
response = automate_email_response(email)
print("Automated Response:", response)
```

#### JavaScript Example
```javascript
// quick_start.js
require('dotenv').config();
const OpenAI = require('openai');

const client = new OpenAI();

async function automateEmailResponse(emailContent) {
    const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
        messages: [
            {role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant that drafts professional email responses.'},
            {role: 'user', content: `Draft a response to this email: ${emailContent}`}
        ]
    });
    return response.choices[0].message.content;
}

// Test it out
const email = "Hi, I need help with setting up the new software. When can we schedule a call?";
automateEmailResponse(email).then(response => {
    console.log('Automated Response:', response);
});
```

### Step 5: Test Your Setup (3 minutes)

Run your script:
```bash
# Python
python quick_start.py

# JavaScript
node quick_start.js
```

You should see an automated email response generated by AI!

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Programming environment set up
- [ ] OpenAI API key configured
- [ ] Environment variables working
- [ ] First AI automation running
- [ ] Response generated successfully

## 🎯 What You Just Built

Congratulations! You've created your first AI automation that:
- Takes email content as input
- Uses AI to generate a professional response
- Outputs the response for you to review and send

## 🔄 Next Steps

Now that you have the basics working, you can:

1. **Explore More Examples**: Check out `/code-samples/` for more advanced automations
2. **Run Demos**: Try the live demos in `/demos/`
3. **Customize**: Modify the prompts to match your specific needs
4. **Scale Up**: Add error handling, logging, and batch processing

## 🛠️ Common Extensions

### Add Error Handling
```python
try:
    response = automate_email_response(email)
    print("Success:", response)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", str(e))
```

### Save to File
```python
with open('responses.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write(f"Original: {email}\n")
    f.write(f"Response: {response}\n\n")
```

### Add Different Prompt Styles
```python
def automate_with_style(email_content, style="professional"):
    styles = {
        "professional": "Draft a professional business response",
        "friendly": "Draft a warm, friendly response",
        "brief": "Draft a brief, concise response"
    }
    
    prompt = f"{styles[style]} to this email: {email_content}"
    # ... rest of the code
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"API key not found" error**
- Check that your `.env` file is in the right directory
- Verify the API key is correctly formatted
- Make sure you're loading the environment variables

**"Rate limit exceeded" error**
- Wait a moment and try again
- Consider adding delays between API calls
- Check your OpenAI usage limits

**Import errors**
- Make sure packages are installed: `pip install openai python-dotenv`
- Check your Python/Node.js version

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple automations before building complex workflows
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Always review AI-generated content before using it
3. **Monitor Costs**: Keep track of your API usage to avoid surprises
4. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on the results you get
5. **Stay Secure**: Never expose your API keys in code or public repositories
