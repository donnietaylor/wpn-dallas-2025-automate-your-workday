# Boss Request Buster – GitHub Spark Prompt

Build an app called “Boss Request Buster”.

Target audience: typical IT pros / sysadmins working in Microsoft-centric environments (Entra ID / Azure AD, Intune, Azure, Exchange Online, Windows Server, on-prem AD, VMware, etc.).

The purpose of the app:  
Turn vague, natural-language “boss requests” into clear automation plans plus ready-to-run artifacts (scripts, queries, emails, etc.) that an IT pro can copy, tweak, and execute.

---

## Core experience

Build a single-page app with a three-panel layout.

---

### Left panel – “Boss Inbox”

A large textarea labeled “Paste your boss request…” with helper text like:  
“e.g., ‘I need a list of all laptops older than 4 years with no MFA enabled by end of day.’”

A dropdown “Urgency” (Low, Normal, High, “Fire Drill 🔥”).

A multi-select “Tech Surface” with common options:  
Entra ID / Azure AD  
Intune  
Exchange Online  
Azure VMs & Log Analytics  
On-prem AD & Windows Servers  
VMware / Hyper-V  
“Not sure / mixed bag”

A primary button: “Bust this request”.

Below the input, show a list of clickable sample boss requests that will prefill the textarea when clicked, for demo purposes. Examples:  
“Give me a list of all users who haven’t enrolled in MFA and highlight executives.”  
“Pull all Windows laptops older than 4 years that are still active in Intune.”  
“Show me servers with disk space below 10% in the last 24 hours.”  
“Find sign-in failures for the CEO in the last 7 days and summarize the root cause.”  
“Restart the Print Spooler service on all print servers and send me proof it worked.”

---

### Middle panel – “AI Interpretation & Plan”

When the user submits, call a generative AI model (using Spark’s built-in AI capabilities) with a well-structured prompt that:

Summarizes the boss request in 1–2 sentences.

Classifies it into one primary Request Type:  
Reporting / List  
Investigation / Troubleshooting  
Change / Remediation  
Compliance / Audit  
Communication / Status Update

Extracts a structured “automation blueprint” object:  
goals: list of concrete outcomes (“Identify all non-MFA users”, “Limit to execs group”, etc.)  
systems: list of relevant systems (Entra ID, Intune, Exchange, Azure VMs, on-prem AD, etc.)  
data_sources: list (e.g., Entra sign-in logs, Intune device inventory, Log Analytics, event logs).  
constraints: time ranges, OU/scopes, device platforms, “don’t cause downtime”, etc.  
risk_flags: potential risks (“modifies production”, “needs CAB approval”, “requires elevated access”).

Returns an ordered list of 2–6 high-level steps that an IT pro would follow to fulfill the request.

Visually show:

A card with the summary and a badge for Request Type.  
A step-by-step “Execution Plan” (numbered list) based on the AI output.  
A small “Risk & Reality Check” section that:  
Lists any risk_flags in plain language.  
Reminds the user that generated scripts are suggestions, not automatically executed.

---

### Right panel – “Generated Automation Kit”

Use the same AI call (or a chained call) to produce concrete artifacts for the IT pro:

Scripts (primarily PowerShell) tailored to the inferred environment.  
KQL queries for Log Analytics / Sentinel / Entra sign-in logs when appropriate.  
Microsoft Graph / REST examples where relevant.  
A sample status email / Teams message they can send back to the boss, summarizing findings or confirming the plan.

Render each artifact in its own card with:

A heading (e.g., “PowerShell: List Entra users without MFA”, “KQL: Disk usage from Log Analytics”).  
A code block with a copy button.  
A short “How to run this” note in plain English (e.g., “Run in PowerShell with Connect-MgGraph and the User.Read.All permission granted.”).

Include a “Confidence & Effort” chip (Low / Medium / High) and a “Time to Complete” estimate (rough guess in minutes/hours) generated by the AI.

---

## Data & history

Implement a simple data store using Spark’s built-in storage so each “busted” request is saved as a record with:

id  
boss_request_text  
created_at  
urgency  
request_type (from the AI classification)  
systems (Entra, Intune, etc.)  
artifacts (summary of what was generated: scripts, queries, etc.)

Add a “History” view accessible via a top-level tab or button:

Display a table of past requests with columns: Date, Short Summary, Request Type, Urgency, Systems, and a “View Details” button.  
Clicking a row opens the full AI plan and artifacts for that run (reuse the middle/right panels in a read-only mode).  
Allow filtering history by Request Type, System, and Urgency.

---

## AI prompt design (what the app should ask the model)

For the AI integration, have Spark:

Create a single reusable server-side AI function that:

Accepts the boss request text, urgency, and selected systems as input.

Returns a predictable JSON payload with:

summary  
requestType  
goals[]  
systems[]  
dataSources[]  
constraints[]  
riskFlags[]  
steps[] (high-level plan)  
artifacts object containing:  
powershellScripts[] (each with title, description, code)  
kqlQueries[] (title, description, code)  
restExamples[] (title, description, code)  
statusMessage (plain-text or markdown)  
notesForHuman (warnings, manual checks, prerequisites)

The system prompt for the model should emphasize:

The audience is experienced IT pros who prefer PowerShell and KQL and live in Microsoft 365 / Azure / Windows ecosystems.  
Scripts should be safe by default: prefer read-only/listing commands first, and clearly mark destructive actions as such.  
Use realistic cmdlets and modules (e.g., Microsoft.Graph, AzureAD, Az, Get-IntuneManagedDevice, Get-WinEvent, etc.), even if the user will need to adjust details later.  
Always include at least one script or query plus a status message back to the boss.

The UI should gracefully handle model errors with a friendly message and guidance like:  
“If this keeps happening, simplify the boss request or select fewer systems.”

## UI & UX expectations

Use a modern, dashboard-style layout suitable for projection in a conference demo:

Clear section headers: “Boss Inbox”, “AI Interpretation & Plan”, “Generated Automation Kit”.  
A subtle IBM / Microsoft-admin vibe: neutral background, strong typography, minimal but distinct accent color.  
Make sure the main flow (type request → click Bust this request → see plan + artifacts) is obvious and works without extra configuration.  
Show a small animated loading state when the AI is working, with fun text like:  
“Decoding boss-speak into action items…”  
“Turning panic into PowerShell…”  
Make the sample boss requests very visible so in a live demo I can just click one and immediately show results.

---

## Non-goals and safety

Do NOT actually execute any scripts or commands; this app only generates and explains them.

Make it very clear in the UI that:

All scripts and queries are examples that must be reviewed and tested by a human before running.  
The app is for planning and acceleration, not unattended production changes.

---

## Nice-to-have demo polish (if feasible)

Show a small “Boss Satisfaction Meter” on each result, derived from the AI’s guess of how well the artifacts answer the original request (e.g., Low / Medium / High, with a playful emoji).

Allow exporting a single “automation kit” as a markdown snippet that bundles:

The summarized request  
The high-level plan  
The key script / query  
The status message  

So I can paste it into a ticket, email, or Teams message.

---

## Please

Use Spark’s default React + TypeScript stack.  
Use Spark’s built-in data storage for history.  
Use Spark’s AI integration (GitHub Models) for interpretation and artifact generation.  
Keep the code organized and readable so I can later open it in a Codespace and extend it.
